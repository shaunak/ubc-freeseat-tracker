# course-freeseat-tracker

This was created because some departments dont do waitlists (MATH) and I wanted to take Math 344 (Game theory). 

Instructions:
You'll need a Twilio account: www.twilio.com/referral/KDkBss (this is my referral link :)) 

once you've set up a Twilio phone number, create a file called secrets.py like so

`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = ""
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = ""
MY_PHONE_NUMBER = ""
MY_TWILIO_NUMBER = ""
`
and fill out the fields appropriately. `MY_PHONE_NUMBER` is the number that will be texted.

In main.py, replace COURSE_URL with whatever UBC SSC link you want.

Be sure you have all the dependencies installed and then run the program.
